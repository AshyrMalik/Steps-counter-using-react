# Steps Counter Using React

This project is a simple web application that counts and tracks the user's steps using React. The app uses device motion data (such as accelerometer or gyroscope data) to estimate the number of steps taken by the user.

## Overview

The Steps Counter app is built with React to demonstrate how to interact with device motion APIs to track steps. This application allows users to start, stop, and reset their step count, offering an intuitive interface for tracking physical activity.

## Project Structure

- **public/**: Contains the static files, including icons and images.
- **src/**: Contains the source code for the React app.
  - **components/**: Reusable components like `StepCounter`, `StartStopButton`, and `ResetButton`.
  - **styles/**: CSS files to style the app interface.
  - **App.js**: The main app component that integrates the step counter functionality.
  - **index.js**: The entry point of the application.
- **README.md**: Project documentation.

## Features

- **Step Counting**: Counts steps using device motion API data.
- **Start/Stop**: Allows users to start and stop the step counting.
- **Reset**: Option to reset the step count.
- **Real-time Tracking**: Shows the number of steps in real-time as they are counted.
- **Responsive Interface**: The app is fully responsive, making it easy to use on any device.

## Installation
